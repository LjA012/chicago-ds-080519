    "> The goal of this analysis is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in a given city in Australia, based on today's weather. We analyzed a Kaggle dataset of (daily weather data <- bold 'daily weather data' and delete everything else in the parentheses!) collected in 49 Australian cities between 2010 and 2018. The final model had an 83.9% accuracy rate in predicting whether or not it would rain tomorrow vs. a baseline model accuracy of 77.8%.

    ">>Our goal is to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow, in a given city in Australia, based on today's weather, using replicable machine learning techniques. We used two separate modeling techniques (Decision Tree and Random Forest) to create these forecasts.\n",
